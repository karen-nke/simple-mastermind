# Python Mastermind Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Python Mastermind Computer Game! This simple console-based game challenges you to guess a 4-color code. The objective is to guess the correct colors in the correct order with as few attempts as possible.

## Rules

- The computer is thinking of a 4-color code, and your task is to guess it.
- You have 10 attempts for each round.
- After each guess, you'll receive hints about the correctness of your colors and their positions.
- The available colors are Green(G), Blue(B), Yellow(Y), White(W), and Red(R).
- Colors may be repeated in the code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the Python file.
2. Run the Python script in your terminal or preferred Python environment.

## Gameplay

1. Input your guesses using the letters G, B, Y, W, R.
2. Receive feedback after each guess, indicating correct colors and positions.
3. Aim to guess the code in as few attempts as possible.
